 * Query structure for Baler query library.

 * All of the query fields in this structure can set to be NULL or 0 to
 * disable the condition in that particular category. For example, if \c hst_ids
 * is NULL, then the query will obtain messages with on all hosts. If \c ts_0 is
 * set but \c ts_1 is 0, then the output would be all messages that occurred
 * after \c ts_0. Similarly, with \c ts_1 set and \c ts_0 unset, the query is
 * all messages before \c ts_1.
 *
 * \c store is a pointer to the store handle for this query.
 * \c itr Is the message iterator from the store which will be re-used in the
 * case of long query that cannot get all of the results in the single query
 * call.
