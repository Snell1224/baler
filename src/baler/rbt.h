 * the case that the callback function decides to add a new rbn into the tree,
 * the output parameter \c *new_rbn shall be set.
 *
 * The callback function shall return one of the following:
 *   - RBT_VISIT_ACTION_NOP for doing nothing to the tree
 *   - RBT_VISIT_ACTION_INS insert *new_rbn (output param) into the rbt
 *   - RBT_VISIT_ACTION_DEL to delete the found_rbn
